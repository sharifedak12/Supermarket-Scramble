# Supermarket Scramble
This game was completed as my capstone project for Ada Developers Academy!

A tale as old as time... now that summer is upon us, you're headed off to Capital City to help your Uncle Frankie out with his grocery delivery service. Collect all of the grocery items before the clock runs out (or you'll have to do it again!)

Features:

- Customers who will block and frustrate you
- Carts that you can push around, unlike the customers (who will also push you, so be careful!)
- An endearing storyline
- Strategy as you plot out your best course of action!
- Total run-through time for the game is about 15 minutes, or more if levels need to be repeated, of course.

# Setup
To set up this repo, install and download Unity - this project was built using Unity 2021.3.7f1. No further dependancies are required.
After you have installed Unity, open Unity Hub and select Open>Add project to disk and point to the location of your local respository.

* Installation
Game has been deployed to: https://fakeradish.itch.io/supermarket-scramble
I have included both an in-browser playing experience as well as desktop versions for Mac and Windows. For desktop versions, all you need to do is unzip. Depending on your security settings on MacOS, you may need to authorize the app by going into Settings>Security>Open Anyway.
